This is a simple script that takes a range of IP addresses in a text doc, row by row, and creates corresponding CIDR notation ranges for each row

The output will almost always include more CIDR ranges as this script will not include additional IP addresses -- just those that are included in the initial range

Refer to the sample script for how the script expects the plaintext doc to be formatted
